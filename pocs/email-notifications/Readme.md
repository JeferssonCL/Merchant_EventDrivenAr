### Provider Evaluation

1. **Ease of Use**: How easy is it to integrate the service into your application?
2. **Delivery Rate**: How effective is the service in ensuring that emails reach the recipients?
3. **Documentation**: How clear and accessible is the documentation provided by the provider?
4. **Support**: What kind of support does the provider offer in case of issues?

## Conclusion

Based on the example we were able to identify which using the SMTP protocol for email notifications best suits our needs, both in terms of ease of implementation and correct operation.

In our example applying or implementing this protocol:
1. **Creation of `GmailService`**: When `GmailService` is instantiated, the constructor of the base class (`BaseEmailService`) configures the SMTP client with Gmailâ€™s settings.
2. **Call to `SendSimpleNotificationAsync`**: This method calls `SendEmailAsync`, which configures and sends the message with the predefined subject and body.
3. **Asynchronous Sending**: `SendEmailAsync` sends the message using `SmtpClient`, allowing the application to continue running while the email is sent in the background.
